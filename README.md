   ```

4. **Run migrations**:
   - Make sure your database is set up correctly in `settings.py`. Then run:
   ```bash

   - If you want to access the Django admin, create a superuser:
   ```bash
   python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

6. **Run the development server**:
   - Start the server to see your application in action:
